                         <h2>Introduction</h2>
                         <p >Nice to “meet”  you!!!
                            
                            My name is Mari Haruno Baker, but everyone calls me Haru or Haru-sensei.
                            
                            I've been teaching and supporting children with special needs and children who are difficult to go to school, or who don’t have confidence for over 15 years.
                            I have been teaching Japanese to adults and kids for over 10 years.
                            
                            Also, I have supported Japanese people who are thinking to study abroad in Canada or who are already in canada for several years.
                            
                            I love teaching and motivating people!!
                            Learning Japanese is great, but getting confidence to enjoy yourself in this society is
                            the most important and in order to achieve the aims, I would like to support you and I always believe that is my mission!!
